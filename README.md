A **RESTful API** for managing notes with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  
Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes. Currently uses **in-memory storage** and can be extended to MongoDB for persistence.  

---

## 🌟 Features

- CRUD operations for notes (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Input validation for required fields (`title` and `content`)  
- Simple RESTful design, easy to integrate with frontend  
- Ready to extend with MongoDB or authentication  

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Data Storage:** In-memory JavaScript array  
- **Testing Tools:** Postman, Insomnia, or Thunder Client

## ⚡ Example curl Commands

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/notes

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/notes \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title":"Test Note","content":"This is a test note."}'

curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/notes/1 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title":"Updated Title"}'

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/notes/1
```

## 🛠 Roadmap

1. Current: In-memory CRUD API
2. Next: Connect API to **MongoDB** for persistent storage
3. Future: Add **user authentication (JWT)**
4. Later: Deploy API on cloud platforms (Heroku, Render, Vercel)

### ✅ Steps to Add Screenshots / GIFs

1. **Take screenshots** of API requests using Postman or Thunder Client.  
2. **Save them** in your repo folder: e.g., `/screenshots/get-notes.png`.  
3. **Reference them in README** using Markdown:  

```markdown
![Description](./screenshots/get-notes.png)
````

4. Optional: **Record a GIF** showing a POST → GET flow (use **ShareX**, **LICEcap**, or **ScreenToGif**) and embed:

```markdown
![Demo GIF](./screenshots/demo.gif)
```

---

If you want, I can **make a ready-to-use GitHub README** with **dummy images/GIF placeholders** so you can just drop your screenshots and it’s portfolio-ready immediately.

Do you want me to do that?


Perfect! Here’s a **ready-to-use GitHub README template** with placeholders for screenshots and a GIF. You can just replace the placeholder images with your actual screenshots/GIFs.

✅ **Instructions for Use:**  
1. Create a folder `screenshots` in your repo.  
2. Add your actual screenshots/GIFs using the same filenames as placeholders (`get-notes.png`, `post-note.png`, etc.).  
3. Push to GitHub. The README will automatically display the images.
